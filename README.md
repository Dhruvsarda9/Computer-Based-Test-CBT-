**Computer Based Examination (CBT)**

This project is an online exam system that allows students to take exams from anywhere. The system is built using "JavaSwing" library and does not require a database. 

The system has the following key features:
1) The exam consists of multiple-choice questions
2) Ability to bookmark questions to revisit it later before submission
3) No database required
4) Management and updation/deletion of question and answers
5) Immediate score card system and feedback of the examination

The system is designed to be easy to use and to provide a convenient way for students to take exams. The system is also scalable, so it can be easily modified to accommodate more questions or more users. The project is a good example of how Java Swing can be used to create a simple but effective user interface. Additionally, it demonstrates how to use Java arrays and files to store data without a database.

The project is still under development, but it is already functional and can be used to take exams. The project is open-source, so anyone can contribute to its development.

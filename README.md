**Computer Based Examination (CBT)**

This project is an online examination system that allows students to take exams from anywhere. The system is built using "JavaSwing" library, this project is very basic as it does not uses any web technologies 

The system has the following key features:
1) The exam consists of multiple-choice questions
2) It can dynamically update the questions, options and answerswers
3) We can navigate between the questions using previous and next buttons
4) Immediate score card system and feedback of the examination

The system is designed to be easy to use and to provide a convenient way for students to take exams. The system is also scalable, so it can be easily modified to accommodate more questions or more users. The project is a good example of how Java Swing can be used to create a simple but effective user interface. Additionally, it demonstrates how to use Java arrays and files to store data.

The project is still under development, but it is already functional and can be used to take exams. The project is open-source, so anyone can contribute to its development.
